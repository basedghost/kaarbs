# kaarbs
kojiros automated arch ricing bash script

This script is intended to be a quick/lazy way of auto-installing all the packages I normally would but with the option to pick and choose what you want to install. This is mainly for my personal use, however others could use it. Because of my lack of technical knowledge it does still require a *slight* amount of tinkering afterwards, but this should do for now.

How to use:
- Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/basedghost/kaarbs/ && cd kaarbs; mv kaarbs_*.sh ~/kaarbs.sh; cd ..`
- Make the script executable: `sudo chmod +x kaarbs.sh`
- To run the script: `./kaarbs.sh`

This script has been tested on a fresh Arch Linux install (using the archinstall script + multilib repo enabled + networkmanager + xfce4 DE)

This script pulls dotfiles from my personal repository:
